## How to Use?
First you must create a new environment for the project.

If not installed, you can install [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) or [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

once anaconda install, create a new virtual env with the following command
```
$ conda create --name mvt_recognition python=3.8.13
```

make sure to activate this env with the following command

```
$ conda activate mvt_recongnition
```
Navigate in a work directory of your choice using cd
Now create a new folder and move into with the following commands

```
$ mkdir cloned_dir
```

```
$ cd cloned_dir
```

Now clone this repository in your directory
use this
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Nathanf22/Mouvement-Recognition.git
```

or this

```
$ git clone git@github.com:Nathanf22/Mouvement-Recognition.git
```

use the second if you know how to setup ssh

Move into the cloned folder using cd

```
$ cd Mouvement-Recognition
```

install requirements with the folloing command

```
$ pip install -m requirements.txt
```

Download the model [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wN2vFiUG3KeVkALdQNBpYWWJGMfjED6z/view?usp=sharing) and put it in the root diretory of the project, or use the following command to directly download it.

```
$ wget https://drive.google.com/u/2/uc?id=1wN2vFiUG3KeVkALdQNBpYWWJGMfjED6z&export=download
```


To Test this model, execute the test.py file,
Modify the code to test on the differents videos.
I encourage you to add your proper videos and test on it


To add a video, each video must have the following characteristics:

Haved been recorded at 30 fps with a depth camera
must contains exactly 90 frames
the depth map have to be placed in Depth folder with the same name than the rgb video

## Documentation

check a look at this document to understand how the model have been created.
