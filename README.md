## How to Use?

Note the versions of the libraries used;

- Tensorflow: 2.8.0
- Numpy: 1.22.3
- Python: 3.8.13


To Test this model, execute the test.py file,
Modify the code to test on the differents videos.
I encourage you to add your proper videos and test on it


To add a video, each video must have the following characteristics:

Haved been recorded at 30 fps with a depth camera
must contains exactly 90 frames
the depth map have to be placed in Depth folder with the same name than the rgb video

## Documentation

check a look at this document to understand how the model have been created.
